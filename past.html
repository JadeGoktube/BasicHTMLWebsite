                <h3>My HSC</h3>
                <article class="content">
                    <p>During my HSC I studied Business, Economics and Software Design and Development, Maths Extension 1 and English Advanced as my electives. Inititally I had also studied English Extension which I enjoyed and performed well in but quit purely due to the fact it required waking up early. Comparing the subjects I studied and my current degree there is a very obvious connection and I realised a lot of the uni content I already know. Fortunately I applied for early entry to UTS and was accepted with a conditional offer which eliminated a lot of the stress of the HSC. <br><br> My favourite subject by far was definitely Software Design and Development, I had a great teacher and the classes were always enjoyable. I'm glad a lot of the content is re-visited in Web Systems.

                        Prior to moving to Sydney, I worked in a women's fashion small business as a store assistant for 4 years whilst in high school. After moving to Sydney I applied for various jobs. After searching many avenues I found a job at NEXTDC, an ASX100 listed data centre outsourcing company in which I still work as a customer service representative. This job was a great opportunity for me as it connected me with the tech industry which I was hoping to enter. <br><br>After working for a period of time, I had a period of low weekly hours which promted me to find a second job - a remote job as a personal assistant. I had a productive start to the second job but was overloaded very soon after as the first job increased weekly hours.
