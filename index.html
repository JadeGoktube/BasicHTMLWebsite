                    <p>I am currently a first year student at the University of Technology Sydney undertaking the Bachelor of Business and Bachelor of Information Technology double degree. I will be majoring in Finance and Networking and Cybersecurity.<br><br>It was a difficult decision choosing between Networking and Cybersecurity and Interaction Design for my IT major but after attending a faculty event and talking to the major coordinators I settled on Cybersecurity with the hopes I can learn design myself.

                        <span>Current Interests and Work</span><br><br> 
                        In my free time I am usually found at the gym, playing games, watching anime, cooking or asleep. Games I enjoy playing recently include CSGO, Beat Saber and Raft. I also have interests in game design and minimalist interior design which I'd love to explore more. <br><br> I currently work two jobs to support myself after moving to the city from the coast. My first job is in a data center and the second job is a remote job, both of which keep me busy in conjunction with full time study. It is hard to find a balance between work, uni, socialising and my free time but I am slowly finding my pace.

                    <p>This website is a brief summary containing information about me, my past, future and the design of this website. The design draws influence from minimal interior design. <br><br>The Home page discusses me, my current interests and introduces the website. The Past page summarises my HSC and work experience whilst the Comments page contains a personal reflection on the website, a technical breakdown, discussion of aesthetics and accessability.
