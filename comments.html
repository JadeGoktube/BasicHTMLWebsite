                <h3>Design Reflection</h3>
                <article class="content">
                    <p>A short, personal reflection on your overall design<br>
                    During the development of this website I used various tools and sources to learn about web design and html and CSS. From the beginning before I had a good foundation in the languages, I created a mock-up of possible designs in a Canva whiteboard. This allowed me to easily figure out how I wanted to structure my website and the components I would need to focus on. When time came to put my designs to practice, I had decided to translate a design with a left aligned vertical navigation bar. After creating a draft according to the first design, I realised that the design would not translate well into a mobile format, this could have been remedied by transforming into a horizontal navigation bar but the novice structure behind could not be modified easily without breaking the page.<br><br>
                    
                     After facing this challenge I decided to start again from the ground-up, learning from the past mistakes and making my html and CSS more efficient for the final version. Restarting also gave me the chance to change my page layout to a horizontal navigation bar which would compact when the screen was smaller, this made the website more consistent.

                        I think I succeeded in translating my interests in minimal design into my website and 
                        !!!!!recommend a maximum screen size should be 1024x768!!!!!

                <h3>Aesthetics</h3>
                <article class="content">
                    <p>The aesthetics of your website - eg: how users should perceive your pages and what effects you were trying to achieve (about half a page).
                      Drawing from my interests in minimal design - my website reflects the desire for simplicity. With a mild colour scheme and extensive use of white space the site provides a soft and clean presenation of the information required. I aimed to replicate the comfortable aesthetics in the overall design using a limited and desaturated colour pallete which is also common with modern style minimal web designs. By utilising transparency effects and gradients on the main div and body element, a softer look is achieved rather than a blank white box. This was inspired by recent graphic design trends of 'glass' elements which create dimension. The main div is elevated from the body by a soft shadow to replicate a paper or page like look and break up excessive white space on the sides created by compacting the text towards the center of the page. The text is focused more towards the center and in tighter paragraphs for more comfortable reading and balance between text and images.<br><br>

                      To maintain the clean look of the website without additional clutter underneath images; the sources of the photos were added into the title and alt tags, which would appear on hover or in place of the image. The image choice is consistent throughout - utlising cool tones and visual representations of the style inspiration. Like the images, the website highlights the structural and design features over personal details - hence why there is no images of myself or people.

                        My website was designed primarily for desktop viewing, it is based off the most common resolution of 1920px width for the best viewing but is adaptable and flexible for a wide range of screen widths, smaller and bigger to be compatible with mobile phones and tablets. 

                        The minimal colour pallete utilises contrast in the case of visual impairments or different display settings such as colour-blindness or black and white modes, allowing the content to still be legible and accessible.

                        Images have alternative text for the case of inaccessible image data, allowing accessibility for blind people and people with limitations resulting in the image being unable to be displayed.

                        Text size is large and broken down into clearly defined sections in a consistent sans-serif font to minimise visual noise and increase legibiliy to ease of reading for those with difficulties reading such as older people. 
                        The language attribute 'en' is specified in the html tag for each page to aid browsers and search engines in identifying and translating the texts within the website. This allows the potential for greater accessibility for users who can't read English.
